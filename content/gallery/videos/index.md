      Blender Studio’s 13th open movie is an 80’s-inspired horror comedy, set in
      Britain: When a group of rowdy teenagers trek into an isolated forest,
      they discover peaceful mushroom creatures that turn out to be an
      unexpected force of nature.

      Blender Studio’s 14th Open Movie is a high-visual-impact, action-packed
      3-minutes-long animation inspired by the game cinematics and realtime
      demos formats.


      The goals of the project are to challenge Blender and the creative team to
      pursue realism and push Blender’s capabilities in the interactive PBR
      workflow.
